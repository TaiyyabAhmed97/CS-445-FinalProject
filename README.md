#CS -445-FinalProject
to configure this app,
first run the ./depends script in your working folder which will install all dependencies
once the ./depends script is run, the project will now be listening on the 8080 localhost server
to run the tests, restart the server and navigate to 'CS445FinalProject' directory and run './codetest' will give the code coverage of the tests and run the tests.
-known bugs are the last 2 API endpoints could not be implemented due to time constraints, the search and the Donations and Revenue Reports. Code Coverage is at 41.98% also due to time constraints
Credits and Acknowledgements:
I'd like to credit the professor, he did inform us that this would be a very long project and I definitely learnt alot.
